# Welcome to Melodeon!
Melodeon adds situational music. You can even add your own!

## What does that mean?
This means that specific music will play depending on the biome or structure you're in.

## Custom Music Instructions
1) Get your music ready:
- Make sure you have three files (enter, ambient, leave)
- Save music as mono ogg
- Rename file by corresponding pattern: [sound_type].[mod_id].[biome_id]
  ex. **ambient.minecraft.plains**
  
2) Add your music files to **{run_folder}/MelodeonSounds/**
   
3) That's it! You're ready to go, just dont forgot to restart your game!

*This mod will also *eventually* have its own music packaged inside, but you will still be able to add your own music
